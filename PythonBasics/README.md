# Basics Module 

Python Basics is the free course with which i had started my path into Programming. It offers 
so much value in very short time period. It lasts only 2 months and give you the perfect idea 
of what coding is. 

On the fifth on March 2023 i singed up. 
I literally fell in love with Programming and it fired my soul. In fact, it never stopped burning since then.
My vision is clear and i want to keep solving problem after problem while achieving my true dream.

  Becoming the best Programmer out there!
